<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head><body>patw: I want to use the mongo change stream API to listen to insert/update events on a collection and call an external REST API to generate vector embeddings which will be stored back into the collection.
Wizard ðŸ§™: <p>To achieve this, you can follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up a MongoDB instance and create a collection where you want to listen for changes.</li>
<li>Initialize the change stream using the <code>MongoClient</code> and your database name, collection name, and an options object with the <code>changeStream</code> option set to true.</li>
<li>Connect to the external REST API by making HTTP requests from your MongoDB server (using libraries like <code>axios</code> or <code>requests</code>) whenever a change occurs in the collection.</li>
<li>When you receive a response from the REST API, generate the vector embeddings.</li>
<li>Store these vector embeddings back into the collection using MongoDB's update operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a sample code snippet demonstrating this process:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import requests # or axios if you're using Node.js

# Set up your MongoDB connection
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['your_database']
collection = db['your_collection']

# Initialize the change stream
change_stream = collection.watch([], full_document='updateLookup')

# Function to handle changes in the collection
def handle_changes(change):
    # Extract the necessary information from the change document
    operation_type = change['operationType']
    document_key = change['fullDocument']['_id']
    
    if operation_type == 'update':
        # Call your external REST API to generate vector embeddings
        response = requests.post('https://your-rest-api.com/generate_embeddings', json={...})  # Replace with your actual endpoint and payload
        
        # Store the vector embeddings back into MongoDB
        collection.update_one(
            {'_id': document_key},
            {"$set": {"vector_embedding": response.json()["embedding"]}}  # Assuming your API returns an "embedding" field
        )

# Start consuming changes from the change stream
for change in change_stream:
    handle_changes(change)
</code></pre>

<p>Please adapt this code to fit your specific use case, such as replacing the REST API URL and payload with the actual endpoints and data you're working with.</p>
